	<h1>Rate Limited Request (429 error)</h1>
        
   
      
<p>We apologize, but you have triggered rate limiting by our cloud service provider.</p>

<p>This could be for one of many reasons.
</p><ul class="bullets">
<li>You accessed more than thirty pages in less than a minute.</li>
<li>You have written a bot that accessed too many files too quickly.</li>
<li>Multiple people are accessing the site at the same time via your IP address.</li>
<li>You are an employee of ESPN.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, we block traffic that we think is from a bot for an hour and traffic that we think is a real user for five minutes.

<h2>Bot Policy</h2>

<p>Sports Reference is primarily dependent on ad revenue, so we must
  ensure that actual people using web browsers have the best possible
  experience when using this site.  Unfortunately, non-human traffic, ie
  bots, crawlers, scrapers, can overwhelm our servers with the number of
  requests they send us in a short amount of time.  Therefore we are
  implementing rate limiting on the site.  We will attempt to keep this
  page up to date with our current settings.


  </p><p>Currently we will block users sending requests to:

    </p><ul class="bullets">
      <li>our sites more often than twenty requests in a minute.</li>
      <li>This is regardless of bot type and construction and pages accessed.</li>
      <li>If you violate this rule your session will be in jail for an hour.</li>
      </ul>



   <p><strong>Why Not Provide an API?</strong></p>

        <p>Most of our data comes from third parties who sell the data to
	    us.  As part of our agreements with them we can not provide the data
	    available as a download on our site.  We are aware that an API would
	    mitigate some issues, but it's not our business model.  If you want
	    to get data for a low price, we suggest NatStat.com.
